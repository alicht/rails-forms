## Rails Forms

### Learning Objectives
-  Discuss forms in rails
-  The magical form_tag
-  See all the special Rails form helper syntax 
-  Fill out the CUD in our app

To best understand Rails forms, we'll build a form and explain what everything is and what's going on as we go along

# CUD
## Setting up our rails app

Fork and clone this repo and follow these steps:
- cd into `CatApp`
- run `bundle install`
- run `rails db:create`
- run `rails db:migrate`
- run `rails db:seed`
- run `rails s` and visit `localhost:3000`

# Creating a new Cat

So far, we have `index` and `show` methods in our controller. But we're going to need some others in order to enable full CRUD functionality. What are we going to need? 



### regular HTML form
```html
<form>
  <label>Post title:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="post_title" name="post[title]"><br>
 
  <label>Post description:</label><br>
  <textarea id="post_description" name="post[description]"></textarea><br>
 
  <input type="submit" value="Submit Post">
</form>
```

### what our Rails form will look like

```ruby
<%= form_for(@post) do |f| %>
  <label>Post title:</label><br>
  <%= f.text_field :title %><br>
 
  <label>Post description</label><br>
  <%= f.text_area :description %><br>
 
  <%= f.submit %>
<% end %>
```

-  `form_for` is a ruby method into which a Ruby object is passed. This means that a form that utilizes form_for is directly connected with an Active Record model

-  `form_for` yields a `FormBuilder` object that lets you create form elements that correspond to attributes in the model

-  `form_for` is essentially an advanced form helper that will yield a `FormBuilder` object that you use to generate your form elements (text fields, labels, a submit button, etc.)

-  `form_for` handles the retrieval of values from your object model and will also try to route the form to the appropriate action specified in the controller

-  `form_for` method accepts the instance of the model as an argument. Using this argument, form_for is able to make a bunch of assumptions for you.

-  `form_for` yields an object of class FormBuilder

-  `form_for` automatically knows the standard route (it follows RESTful conventions) for the form data



## Rails paths and URL helpers
 Routes are a great example of this - let's learn how to leverage built-in URL helper methods instead of hard coding route paths into an application.

# We have th 'R', but are missing the 'C', 'U', 'D'

So far, we've done `index` and `show` methods in our controller. But! We are going to need some others in order to create CRUD. Which do we need? What do we get when we run `rails routes`?


## 1) ðŸš€ Create

### `new`

Before we can do anything with our cat form, we need two new controller methods: `new` and `create`. `new` won't do anything for now -- it'll just send back our `new.html.erb` page. `create`, on the other hand, is going to create a new cat!

Let's add to our `new` method to our `cats_controller.rb`:

### `new`
```rb
def new
  @cat = Cat.new
end
```

This will creates a blank `cat` object that we're going to pass into our view.


### `create`
```ruby
def create
  @cat = Cat.new(name: params[:name], breed: params[:breed])
  if @cat.save
    redirect_to cat_path(@cat)
  else
    render :new
  end
end
```
#### what are `redirect_to` & `cat_path`? What are they doing?

Also... wouldn't it be better to check out our params first before we create the cat? We know what a cat needs to have in order to be created. Let's adjust that.

```rb
def create
  @cat = Cat.new(cat_params)
  if @cat.save
    redirect_to cat_path(@cat)
  else
    render :new
  end
end

private
def cat_params
  params.require(:cat).permit(:name, :breed)
end
```
### Using the `form_for` helper


THEN I need to create a view template for it on `views/cats/new.html.erb`:
```ruby
<%= form_for @cat do |f| %>
  <%= f.text_field :name, placeholder: "Name" %>
  <%= f.text_field :breed, placeholder: "Breed" %>
  <%= f.submit "New cat"%>
<% end %>
```

#### and let's add a link to this on our `index` page so we can see it

`views/cats/index.html.erb`:

and add in: 
```ruby
<%= link_to "New Cat", new_cat_path %>
```

### `link_to` method
As you can see, even though we never added HTML code for the link â€“â€“ e.g., <a href="..."></a> â€“â€“ the link_to method rendered the correct tag for us.


# Let's examine `form_for`
{{{ it goes through and explains line by line what each thing is https://learn.co/tracks/full-stack-web-dev-with-react/rails/crud-with-rails/form_for-on-edit }}}

We're saying that we expect there to be a `cat` in what we get back from the server, and that cat should have the fields `name` and `breed`.

Instead of having to write the form ourselves, with the path and the method and the CSRF token and everything, it's now generated for us with this `form_for` tag! Yay!


### We now have the ability to create a new cat!!

## 2) ðŸš€ Edit

First thing we have to do is add the `edit` action to our `cats_controller.rb`

```ruby
  def edit
    @cat = Cat.find(params[:id])
  end
```

THEN I need to create a view template for it on `views/cats/edit.html.erb`:
-  Note: the Edit form is very similar to New form
```ruby
<%= form_for @cat do |f| %>
  <%= f.text_field :name, placeholder: "Name" %>
  <%= f.text_field :breed, placeholder: "Breed" %>
  <%= f.submit "Edit cat"%>
<% end %>
```
### and... we created it!
but...  we want to see the `edit` link on the page:
=> in `views/show.html.erb`
-  look at `rails routes` so we can figure out the path

```ruby
<%= link_to "Edit Cat", edit_cat_path(@cat) %>
```
`(@cat)` will transform to the id & make it the right path


### ok, so we refresh... but we still need an UPDATE method


## 3) ðŸš€ Update

First thing we have to do is add the `update` action to our `cats_controller.rb`

```ruby
  def update
    @cat = Cat.find(params[:id])
    if @cat.update_attributes(cat_params)
      # redirect_to cat_path(@cat)
      redirect_to cats_path
    else
      render :edit
    end
  end
```

Notes:

### Refresh and... EDIT works!!

# 4) ðŸš€ Delete

### First... I need a `destroy` action 
First thing we have to do is add the `destroy` action to our `cats_controller.rb`

```ruby
  def destroy
    @cat = Cat.find(params[:id])
    @cat.destroy
    redirect_to cats_path
  end
```

When we delete a cat, we can still use the `form_for` helper -- we just need to give it some additional information.
Go to `views/cats/show.html.erb`:

```Ruby
<%= form_for @cat, html: {method: "delete"} do |f| %>
  <%= f.submit "Delete #{@cat.name}?" %>
<% end %>
```
We're telling the `form_for` helper that in the HTML for this particular form, the method should be `delete`.


And we now have CRUD functionality!
